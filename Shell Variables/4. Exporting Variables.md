# Exporting Variables
This challenge wants us to invoke /challenge/run with the PWN variable exported and set to the value COLLEGE, and the COLLEGE variable set to the value PWN but not exported .
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{ECNT_i0TJiIjKyGA4cha5bpHUpD.QXyYTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ export PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ COLLEGE=PWN
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ /challenge/run
CORRECT!
You have exported PWN=COLLEGE and set, but not exported, COLLEGE=PWN. Great
job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ECNT_i0TJiIjKyGA4cha5bpHUpD.QXyYTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!

## What I learned 
- By default, variables that you set in a shell session are local to that shell process. That is, other commands you run won't inherit them.
