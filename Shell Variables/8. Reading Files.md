# Reading Files
This challenge wants us to read files with the shell.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{wfBvNeIO6jXm1XmUDaLt7GgDSvE.QXwIDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{wfBvNeIO6jXm1XmUDaLt7GgDSvE.QXwIDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- The challenge redirects /challenge/read_me into the standard input of read, and so when read reads into PWN, it reads from the file.
