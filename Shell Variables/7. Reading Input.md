# Reading Input
This challenge wants us to use read to set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{o127QBNG0kApqkags0e0nzh2fWD.QX4cTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read PWN
COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{o127QBNG0kApqkags0e0nzh2fWD.QX4cTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- Read builtin is used to read input into a variable.
