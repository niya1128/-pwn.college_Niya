# Multi-word variables
This challenge wants us to assign "COLLEGE YEAH" to the variable PWN. Since it has a space, double quotes are compulsory.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{EKmNGOhPPyaUg6Tt0Duq7if-_l0.QXwYTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{EKmNGOhPPyaUg6Tt0Duq7if-_l0.QXwYTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- When the shell sees a space, it ends the variable assignment and interprets the next word as a command. 
- Therefore, double quotes have to be used.
