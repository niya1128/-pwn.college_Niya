# Setting variables
This challenge wants us to assign the value 'COLLEGE' to the variable 'PWN'.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{4O_RhykARx8gTnLsSh7wL1lN70V.QX5UTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{4O_RhykARx8gTnLsSh7wL1lN70V.QX5UTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- There are no spaces around the =.
- If you put spaces (e.g., VAR = 1337), the shell won't recognize a variable assignment and will, instead, try to run the VAR command (which does not exist).
