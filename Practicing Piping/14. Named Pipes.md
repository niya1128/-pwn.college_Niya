# Named Pipes 
This challenge uses making our own named pipes called  'FIFOs'.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{sN0pxptLa6kcZi-3u7xTlU0Jnxo.01MzMDOxwiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/flag_fifo
You're successfully redirecting /challenge/run to a FIFO at /tmp/flag_fifo!
Bash will now try to open the FIFO for writing, to pass it as the stdout of
/challenge/run. Recall that operations on FIFOs will *block* until both the
read side and the write side is open, so /challenge/run will not actually be
launched until you start reading from the FIFO!
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ cat/tmp/flag_fifo
bash: cat/tmp/flag_fifo: No such file or directory
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ cat /tmp/flag_fifo
You've correctly redirected /challenge/run's stdout to a FIFO at 
/tmp/flag_fifo! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sN0pxptLa6kcZi-3u7xTlU0Jnxo.01MzMDOxwiMxEzNzEzW}

## What I learned 
- I learned that FIFO's will block any operations on them until both the read side of the pipe and the write side of the pipe are ready.
