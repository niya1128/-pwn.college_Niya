# Process substitution for input
This challenge wants us to search for the flag by comparing the outputs of commands '/challenge/print_decoys' and '/challenge/print_decoys' using process substitution with diff.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{cWik9wmed5BigYbEebN0QSEItv_.0lNwMDOxwiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@piping~process-substitution-for-input:~$ diff <(/challenge/print_decoys) <(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)
85a86
> pwn.college{cWik9wmed5BigYbEebN0QSEItv_.0lNwMDOxwiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- Process substitution can be used to read and hook up the output of commands to a temporary file that it will create.
- '<' command is used for Process substitution.
