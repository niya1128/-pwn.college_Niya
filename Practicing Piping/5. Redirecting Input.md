# Matching with []
This challenge wants us to transfer the contents of the college file to the PWN file and then to trnasfer contents of PWN as standard input to '/challenge/run'.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{07gX3dYpgyZEolY2UHZa-FTuXsh.QXwcTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{07gX3dYpgyZEolY2UHZa-FTuXsh.QXwcTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- '<' is used for standard input.
## Errors
- This also should've worked, but since we had to use stdin, the permission was denied.
'''
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN > /challenge/run
bash: /challenge/run: Permission denied
