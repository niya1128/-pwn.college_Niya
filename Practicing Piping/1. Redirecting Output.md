# Redirecting Output
This challenge wants us to write the word PWN to the filename COLLEGE.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{I4hBjmW9ACFeAN7LPRiuUC0uOFr.QX0YTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{I4hBjmW9ACFeAN7LPRiuUC0uOFr.QX0YTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- '>' is used to redirect standard output to files.
