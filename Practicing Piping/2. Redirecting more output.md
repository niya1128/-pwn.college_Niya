# Redirecting more output
This challenge wants us to redirect the output of '/challenge/run' command to the file 'myflag' and print the flag using 'cat myflag'.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{EqPfsVRQg6krRKkSq42c5_MJHGA.QX1YTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ /challenge/run > myflag
