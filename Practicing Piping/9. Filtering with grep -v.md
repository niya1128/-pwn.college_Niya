# Filtering with grep -v
This challenge wants us to get the real flag by eliminating all the other flags(that contain the word decoy in them) present in the output of '/challenge/run' using the grep -v command.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{EXhtkT4eqYvB8SLnSqshspY4oSY.0FOxEzNxwiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@piping~filtering-with-grep-v:~$ /challenge/run | grep -v DECOY
pwn.college{EXhtkT4eqYvB8SLnSqshspY4oSY.0FOxEzNxwiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- The grep -v shows lines that do NOT match a pattern.
