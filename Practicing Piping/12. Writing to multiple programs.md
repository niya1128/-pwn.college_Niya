# Writing to multiple programs
This challenge wants us to use process substitution to write to commands.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{EJR5Z7Ryq5zo3AmA4aYW1aRSlbW.QXwgDN1wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
This secret data must directly and simultaneously make it to /challenge/the and
/challenge/planet. Don't try to copy-paste it; it changes too fast.

Congratulations, you have duplicated data into the input of two programs! Here
is your flag:

## What I learned 
- Process substitution can make command output appear as files for reading with <(command).
- For writing to a command (output process substitution), use command '>'.
- If you write an argument of >(rev), bash will run the rev command (this command reads data from standard input, reverses its order, and writes it to standard output!), but hook up its input to a temporary named pipe file.
