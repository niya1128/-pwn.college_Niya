# Moving Files
This challenge wants us to move the file '/file' into the '/tmp/hack-the-planet' file using the mv command and run '/challenge/check' to get the flag.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{cZSGsuUx860Wm57YyXHQnTVNR0k.0VOxEzNxwiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet
Correct! Performing 'mv /flag /tmp/hack-the-planet'.
hacker@commands~moving-files:~$ /challenge/check
Congrats! You successfully moved the flag to /tmp/hack-the-planet! Here it is:
pwn.college{cZSGsuUx860Wm57YyXHQnTVNR0k.0VOxEzNxwiMxEzNzEzW}

## What I learned 
- the mv command is used to move files from one file to the other.
- it moves the file (provided as the first arguement) to the other file (provided as the second argument).
