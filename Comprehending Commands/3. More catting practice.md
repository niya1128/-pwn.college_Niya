# More catting practice
This challenge simply wanted us to use the cat command to read the file flag using its absolute path but this time it was stored in a different directory (/usr/share/zoneinfo-icu) and we were not allowed to use the cd command so it had to be done using the absolute path '/usr/share/zoneinfo-icu/flag'.
# My Solution
**Flag** 'pwn.college{M7Qd4HzBYOTUdE6_PJhJSxzoHTJ.QXwITO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /usr/share/zoneinfo-icu/flag
pwn.college{M7Qd4HzBYOTUdE6_PJhJSxzoHTJ.QXwITO0wiMxEzNzEzW}

# What I learned 
- cat can accept absolute paths to read files
- it can be done without using the cd command
