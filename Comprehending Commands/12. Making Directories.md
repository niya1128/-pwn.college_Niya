# Making Directories
This challenge wants us to create adirectory 'mkdir' and then create a file named 'college' in it using the touch command.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{4kGQuD1OltcaULeviLiTLwnZ08E.QXxMDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ mkdir /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4kGQuD1OltcaULeviLiTLwnZ08E.QXxMDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- mkdir command is used to create new directories.
