# Grepping for a needle in a haystack
This challenge wanted us to use the grep command to read a very long file and to just print the flag.
# My solution
**Flag** 'pwn.college{UB6V6X0OIxO_ZnumX3hohLokTfo.QX3EDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{UB6V6X0OIxO_ZnumX3hohLokTfo.QX3EDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}

# What I learned 
- The 'grep' command can be used to read and display a part of the file.
- It increases the efficiency and there is no need of displaying the whole file.
