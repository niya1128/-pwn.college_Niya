# Searching Manuals
This challenge wants us to search for the flag by navigating in the manual of the challenge command.
**Flag**'pwn.college{wjCBHpsMHqnsXi7O4a0-u0Xk7K5.QX1EDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --ffjukfh
Initializing...
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{wjCBHpsMHqnsXi7O4a0-u0Xk7K5.QX1EDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## My thinking
- To search for the flag i used '/flag' and then navigated using 'n' to go forwards and 'N' to go backwards.
- After finding that '--ffjukfh' will give me the flag, I passed the '--ffjukfh' to the challenge command and got the flag.
