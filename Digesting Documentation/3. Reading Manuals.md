# Reading Manuals
This challenge wants us to look for the int in the man page for the challenge command and then using that to get the flag.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{whM1i9aZbyafmINPYeGHXM0al3I.QX0EDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --whiaby 190
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{whM1i9aZbyafmINPYeGHXM0al3I.QX0EDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- The man (manual) command is used to get more info on a particular command, its use and other specifications.
- The command has to be exexuted properly with the correct arguments to get the desired output which was the error that I faced earlier.
