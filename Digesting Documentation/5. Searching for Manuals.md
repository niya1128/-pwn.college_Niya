# Searching for Manuals
This challenge wants us to search for the flag by searching for the renamed manpage of the challenge program in the manpage of 'man' to get the flag.
**Flag**'pwn.college{UEZu_07f6Fcz9oV55fObWdEcJRx.QX2EDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man man
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man --regex challenge
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --ufczof 076
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{UEZu_07f6Fcz9oV55fObWdEcJRx.QX2EDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}

## My thinking
- After using the 'man man' statement, while reading I saw the "finding a Manpage' section and in that I found the '--regex command' which 
when passed shows all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression
- After this, I used the 'man --regex challenge' command which opened up the manual for the challenge command.
- In the manual, I found that we needed to use the 'ufczof 076' argument with '/challenge/challenge' in order to get the flag.
