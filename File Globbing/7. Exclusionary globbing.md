# Tab Completion
This challenge wants us to list all files that don't start with p, w, or n using '!'.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{w_A1YAe1T-baS9jfim1ZDfePP0b.QX2IDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [!pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{w_A1YAe1T-baS9jfim1ZDfePP0b.QX2IDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''
## What I learned 
- If the first character in the brackets is a ! or (in newer versions of bash) a ^, the glob inverts, and that bracket instance matches characters that aren't listed.
