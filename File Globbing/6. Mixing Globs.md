# Mixing Globs
This challenge wants us to use a 6 or less character glob that will match the files "challenging", "educational".
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{8GTuTmUtDmlv7r3TIaxc0we2JtI.QX1IDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cpe]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{8GTuTmUtDmlv7r3TIaxc0we2JtI.QX1IDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- To use multiple globs together.
## My mistakes
- Earlier I was trying to use the '*' inside the glob '[]'
'''
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [i*n*]
Your expansion did not expand to the requested files (challenging, educational,
pwning). Instead, it expanded to:
[i*n*]
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [*i*n*]
Error: your argument is too long! It must be 6 characters or less.
'''
- The argument '*i*n*' should've worked, but since we're told to use square brackets glob, it doesn't work.
'''
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *i*n*
Error: you did not use a square bracket glob...
