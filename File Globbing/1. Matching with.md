# Matching with *
This challenge wants us to change the directory using the glob '*'.
## My solution
**Flag**'pwn.college{gbLQWK7ZP4cCtkzkYKHhozGok4p.QXxIDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Execution 
'''
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /c*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{gbLQWK7ZP4cCtkzkYKHhozGok4p.QXxIDO0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''

## What I learned 
- This is invalid
'''
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /*l*
bash: cd: too many arguments
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /*e
bash: cd: too many arguments
'''
- To be able to use the glob '*', we have to use the command 'cd /c*'
- This is because, the error means the wildcard created a list of too many places to go and couldn't choose one.
