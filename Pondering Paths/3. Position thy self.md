# Position thy self
This challenge  tells us to execute /challenge/run program from a specific path(/usr/share/doc) using the cd command. It also highilghts the fact that the ~ shows the current path that your shell is located at.
## My solution
**Flag** 'pwn.college{YRz9YKccxT1mah_4tcJEScOI6_a.QX2QTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Now the shell is connected to dojo. Now, on typing 'cd /usr/share/doc' and clicking on Enter, I get the flag that I can submit on [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/linux-luminarium/hello/) to complete the challenge.
'''
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /usr/share/doc
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/usr/share/doc$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YRz9YKccxT1mah_4tcJEScOI6_a.QX2QTN0wiMxEzNzEzW}

# What I learned
- Simply using cd without specifying the path will not change the current workig directory to any new directory, it has to be used with the path specified i.e. /usr/share/doc here.
'''
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/doc directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
