# PONDERING PATHS
This module contains nine challenges that include The Root,Program and absolute paths,Position thy self, Position elsewhere,Position yet elsewhere,implicit relative paths, from /,explicit relative paths, from /, implicit relative path and home sweet home.
# The Root
## My solution
**Flag** 'pwn.college{E38j1IbZtEtRPpcOOiWM7PWA554.QX4cTO0wiMxEzNzEzW}'
1. I connected the dojo host using SSH command.
'''
Dell@DESKTOP-9TLK9SE MINGW64 ~ (master)
$ ssh -i./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
Connected!
'''
2. Now the shell is connected to dojo.Now, on typing '/pwn' and clicking on Enter, I get the flag that I can submit on [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/linux-luminarium/hello/) to complete the challenge.
'''
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{E38j1IbZtEtRPpcOOiWM7PWA554.QX4cTO0wiMxEzNzEzW}
'''
# Note 
/pwn has to be entered otherwise,
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ pwn
It looks like you invoked 'pwn' instead of the absolute path ('/pwn'). You'll
learn more about how this is different later, but suffice it to say: you ran
the wrong thing. Use the absolute path, instead!

# What I learned
-The path that starts with the root directory, is referred to as an "absolute path".
-therefore, /pwn is an absolute path
